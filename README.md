# SimplePHP-Filehandling-Example
This code demonstrates how to add, delete, and restore data in a file using the server-side language PHP. The code allows for real-time updates to a website's content from the server side. This code is part one of Lab oration part 4 in a web programming course, and serves as a good example for learning about forms and basic database operations. While this code does not use a traditional database, it still stores data in a secondary memory location, such as a file.
