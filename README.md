# SimplePHP-Filehandling-Example
In this code you find how to add, delete, restore data in file, permanent memory server-side language PHP to client side Website on real time. 
This is also if not counting the design part is the part one  of Lab oration part 4 in course Webb programming. The part two I will also provide example there.
I think this is a good example for you if you  want to learn how forms and basic database works. NOTS I do not use database here, however, database data are also stored somewhere, 
in this example, where I save the data on secondary memory/file.
